2. To improve security it is also necessary to conduct tests to assess vulnerability in the authorization mechanisms.

3. Ensure that team members can understand how authorization mechanisms are used.

4. Obtain URL analysis and monitoring tools to avoid issues caused by URL parsing inconsistencies.
